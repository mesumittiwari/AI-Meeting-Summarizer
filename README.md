## Overview

The **AI Meeting Summarizer** is a powerful web application designed to streamline your post-meeting workflows. It leverages state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence to automatically transcribe spoken meeting audio and generate concise, actionable summaries. Say goodbye to manual note-taking and missed key points â€“ focus on the discussion, and let the AI handle the rest!

This project aims to provide a robust solution for:
* Converting raw meeting audio into accurate text transcripts.
* Extracting the most important information, decisions, and action items.
* Saving valuable time for individuals and teams.

## Features

* **Audio Transcription:** Upload audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV) and get accurate text transcripts using advanced Speech-to-Text models.
* **AI-Powered Summarization:** Utilizes large language models to condense lengthy transcripts into clear, coherent, and concise summaries.
* **Key Information Extraction:** Automatically identifies and highlights critical decisions, action items, and discussion points.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web interface for easy audio upload, transcription, and summary viewing.
* **Scalable Backend:** Designed with a modular backend for easy integration of different AI models and future enhancements.
* **Secure API Key Handling:** Emphasizes best practices for managing sensitive API keys.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using a modern stack to ensure performance, scalability, and ease of development.

**Backend:**
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **[FastAPI / Flask]:** (Choose one based on your actual implementation, e.g., FastAPI for high performance, Flask for simplicity) A robust web framework for building the API.
* **[Speech Recognition Library]:** (e.g., `SpeechRecognition`, `AssemblyAI`, `Whisper` local or API) For converting audio to text.
* **[Large Language Model (LLM) API]:** (e.g., `OpenAI` GPT-3.5/GPT-4, `Hugging Face` models, `Google Gemini` API) For text summarization.
* **`python-dotenv`:** For managing environment variables.

**Frontend:**
* **[HTML, CSS, JavaScript]:** Standard web technologies for the user interface.
* **[React / Vue / plain JS framework]:** (Specify if you're using a specific frontend framework, otherwise just mention plain JS) For dynamic user experience.

**Deployment & Hosting:**
* **Git:** Version control.
* **GitHub:** Code hosting.
* **Render:** (If applicable) Cloud platform for deploying the web service.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the AI Meeting Summarizer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.9+** (or your specific Python version)
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **Git**

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mesumittiwari/AI-Meeting-Summarizer.git](https://github.com/mesumittiwari/AI-Meeting-Summarizer.git)
    cd AI-Meeting-Summarizer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS / Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd .. # Go back to the project root
    ```
    *Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your `backend` directory. If not, generate one from your current environment:*
    ```bash
    # In the backend directory
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive API keys. You need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the `backend/` directory, create a new file named `.env` (note the leading dot).

2.  **Add your API keys:**
    Populate the `.env` file with your API keys. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys.

    ```dotenv
    # backend/.env

    # Example for OpenAI API Key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

    # Example for Hugging Face API Token (if used, e.g., for inference API)
    HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_access_token_here

    # Add any other API keys or environment-specific variables your backend needs
    ```
    **IMPORTANT:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already included in `.gitignore` for your security.

### Running the Backend

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can start the backend server.

1.  **Navigate to the `backend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Start the server:**
    (Choose the command based on your backend framework: FastAPI with Uvicorn, Flask with Gunicorn, etc.)

    **If using FastAPI with Uvicorn:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    *(`main:app` assumes your FastAPI app instance is named `app` in `main.py`)*

    **If using Flask with a simple Python script:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    *(`app.py` would be your main Flask application file)*

    The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the port you configured).

### Running the Frontend

(Instructions will vary greatly depending on whether you have a separate frontend application, and what framework it uses. Provide specific instructions here.)

If your frontend is a separate application (e.g., in a `frontend` folder):

1.  **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # From the backend directory, or cd frontend from project root
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies (e.g., for a React app):**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application should then open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

**If your frontend is integrated directly with the backend (e.g., Jinja2 templates in Flask):**
No separate steps are needed for the frontend. Once the backend is running, you can access the application through the backend's URL.

## Usage

(Provide clear instructions and examples of how to use the application.)

1.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for a separate frontend, or `http://localhost:8000` if the backend serves the UI).
2.  **Upload Audio:** Use the provided interface to upload your meeting audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV).
3.  **Process:** Click the "Summarize Meeting" or similar button. The application will then:
    * Transcribe the audio.
    * Process the transcript with the AI model.
    * Display the generated summary and extracted key points.
4.  **View Summary:** Read the concise summary and review the extracted action items.
    *(Optional: Add screenshots or GIFs to illustrate the usage.)*
